# DataTau Web Scraper


This is a small project to scrape Datatau's site for all stories and links posted. The code is written using Python's BeautifulSoup package and I've posted an iPython notebook and accompanying .py script for production use. 

You can view the iPython notebook [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/louisryan/Web-Scraping/blob/master/DataTau%20Scrape.ipynb)

If you're not familiar with Datatau's format, an example is provided below:

In essence, a list of links to outgoing news articles and tutorials with some metadata like uploader, points and comments. 

This can easily be adapted to scrape hacker news
